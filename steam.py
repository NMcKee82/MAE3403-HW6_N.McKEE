class SteamTable:
    """
        A simplified interface to obtain thermodynamic properties of water
        and steam for Rankine cycle calculations. This class serves as a
        placeholder for actual steam table data, providing methods to return
        saturated steam properties given pressure, or superheated steam
        properties given pressure and temperature.

        Methods:
        - get_sat_properties(pressure): Returns thermodynamic properties for
          saturated steam at a given pressure.
        - get_superheat_properties(pressure, temperature): Returns properties
          for superheated steam at given pressure and temperature.

                Returns simulated thermodynamic properties for saturated steam at
                a given pressure. Properties include enthalpy of liquid (hf),
                enthalpy of vapor (hg), entropy of liquid (sf), and entropy of
                vapor (sg).

                Parameters:
                - pressure: The pressure of the saturated steam in kPa.

                Returns:
                - A dictionary of properties including hf, hg, sf, sg, h (enthalpy),
                  and s (entropy) for the saturated condition.

                Parameters:
                - pressure: The pressure of the steam in kPa.
                - temperature: The temperature of the steam in Celsius.
